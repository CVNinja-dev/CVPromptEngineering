# We created a list of over 100 possible mistakes in a CV
# Shortlisted them to ~50
# V2 is same as V1 but we provide names of the 50 mistakes to look for
# Also in V2 we ask GPT to return telemetry data like country and work experience

# Outcome: GPT's recommendation and mistake analysis output is not helpful. I suspect the reason is the long list of mistakes.
#Outcome: GPT's telemetry data is accurate.

# Potential improvements in V3: Detail out the mistakes. Also explore if we could train GPT before so that the prompt can contain just the CV to analyse.
